## Ekart App

A simple ecommerce app. I actually did it as a summer project so, and i have tried to eliminate all errors in the existing app ,still some errors may prevail (like some dropdown menus or notifications or AJAX issues!!). This app basically uses ruby on rails framework, ajax applications and postgresql database. Also I am trying to implement angular in this app. 

## Motivation

I started web development an year ago. For practice I came up with this idea.

## Installation
1) For dev
```ruby
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
``` 
2) For production

Make an account on [heroku.com](https://heroku.com)
Push the code to heroku and make sure code uploads successfully (queries are most welcome)

If you did everything correctly and without errors then congrats you have your own social networking platform. Enjoy :-)

## Contributions

Your ideas and any improvements in the current project are most welcome.
